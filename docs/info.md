## What it does

This module emulates the behavior of a WS2812B addressable RGB LED. It is designed to integrate seamlessly into a daisy-chained WS2812B LED strip, acting as a "virtual LED" or "impostor" within the chain.

It receives data on the `DIN` input pin (typically connected to the previous LED in the chain or a microcontroller), extracts and stores the RGB values destined for it, and then forwards the remaining data to the next element in the chain via the `DOUT` output pin. 

This passthrough behavior mimics that of a real WS2812B LED. This allows the module to coexist with actual LEDs or other impostor modules in a daisy-chain configuration.

## Key Features

- Fully compatible timing and protocol emulation with WS2812B devices.
- Can be inserted anywhere in a WS2812B LED chain.
- Extracts and stores the first RGB triplet received (24 bits: G, R, B).
- Exposes internal state via a simple memory-mapped register interface.
- Supports external clearing of the `rgb_ready` latch to detect new data arrivals.

## Register Map

| Address | Name        | Access | Description                                                                 |
|---------|-------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00    | `reg_r`     | R      | Last received **Red** byte                                                  |
| 0x01    | `reg_g`     | R      | Last received **Green** byte                                               |
| 0x02    | `reg_b`     | R      | Last received **Blue** byte                                                |
| 0x0E    | `rgb_clear` | W      | Write `0x00` to clear `rgb_ready`; resets to `0x01` internally after toggle |
| 0x0F    | `rgb_ready` | R      | `0xFF` if new RGB data received (latched), `0x00` after cleared by `rgb_clear` |

> Nota: The WS2812B protocol sends colors in **GRB** order. This peripheral captures and reorders them internally for convenience.

## How to Test

1. Connect a WS2812B signal generator (e.g. microcontroller or FPGA) to the `DIN` input (`ui_in[1]`).
2. Transmit a standard WS2812B data frame with one or more 3-byte RGB values.
3. Once the first 8x3=24 bits are received, the peripheral will:
   - Store the values in the internal registers.
   - Set the `rgb_ready` register to `0xFF` to indicate data availability.
4. The user can now read:
   - `reg_r` (0x00) for RED
   - `reg_g` (0x01) for GREEN
   - `reg_b` (0x02) for BLUE
5. To acknowledge the data and re-arm the peripheral for new RGB input:
   - Write `0x00` to the `rgb_clear` register (0x0E)
   - The `rgb_ready` flag will automatically reset to `0x00`

## External Hardware

- **WS2812B Driver or Controller** (e.g. microcontroller, FPGA logic, cheap chinese led driver)
- **Additional WS2812B LEDs or Impostor Modules**:
  This peripheral supports forwarding of the remaining data to downstream LEDs via the `DOUT` pin, enabling full compatibility with mixed chains of real and imposter devices.

## Applications

- Simulation or logging tools for WS2812B protocols.
- Its cool as hell, how about instead of colours we control servos.
